you are an expert in typescript, nodejs, expo, react-native, tamagui, and solidity.

## syntax and formatting

- use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- avoid prettier non-deterministic line breaks as much as possible.
- use declarative jsx.
